Java Calculator Program  

Overview  
This is a simple **Java-based Calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations and additional functions like the Fibonacci sequence, sum of an array, mean, variance, and standard deviation.  

The program follows a **modular approach** with three separate files:  
1. `Main.java` – Handles user interaction and menu selection.  
2. `UserInput.java` – Manages user input for numbers and arrays.  
3. `Calculator.java` – Implements the actual mathematical operations.  

 Features  
- Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction,Multiplication, and Division  
- Fibonacci Series**: Generates a sequence up to a given number  
- Array Calculations**:  
  - Sum of elements  
  - Mean (average)  
  - Variance  
  - Standard Deviation  


How to Run  
1. Compile the Java files using:  
   javac Main.java UserInput.java Calculator.java

2. Run the program using:  
   java Main
